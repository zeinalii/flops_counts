# FLOPS Counts

This project provides a set of Python scripts to measure and compare the floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) performance of different computational frameworks on various hardware.

## Overview

The project includes three main scripts:

1. `test_numpy.py`: Measures CPU performance using NumPy.
2. `test_tensor.py`: Measures GPU performance using TensorFlow.
3. `test_jax.py`: Measures GPU/TPU performance using JAX.

Each script performs matrix multiplication operations and calculates the FLOPS achieved.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- JAX

## Usage

To run the tests, execute each script separately:
